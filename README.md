# breakout
Created during my university studies

A simple game I created during my 2nd year of studies. Its made with the Open Source Processing Language/IDE -- a simplified version of Java.

Its taken from the 80's classic "Breakout" where the user guides the paddle by using the left and right arrow keys. The paddle deflects the ball
into a wall of bricks, destroying them one-by-one.

Instructions:

Move Left: left arrow key
Move Right: right arrow key
Pause: P key
Start game: ENTER key
